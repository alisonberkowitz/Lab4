Redesigning the UI of Lab 3

Git & Github
---

We made our button more visually pleasing. We made it the color blue that the Android design docs said.
We also made our button darker when you click on it so that it looks like it is pressed, but failed to implement that.

We centered our text and gave our app the name "SnapWhere"
